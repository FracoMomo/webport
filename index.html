                <a id="introfirst">I'm Sebastian Franco Camoro, a 19-year-old living from Cebu, Philippines. As a freshmen on Information Technology at Cebu Institute of Technology University, I am Improving in my skills on web development, media design, and Photography. Passionate about creating art through modern technology, I seek to inspire and create emotionally resonant works to the audiences.</a><br>
                <a><br>I chose Information Technology over Multimedia Arts for both practical and personal reasons. The potential career opportunities and lower costs of IT made it a more sensible choice, even though I was initially drawn to the creative aspects of MMA.

                    My interest in technology began early, with a two-and-a-half-years in a robotics workshops at Saint Theresa's College Cebu. During the pandemic, I honed my design skills by taking the lead on numerous school assignments, driven by a desire to create visually appealing work.
                    
                    I'm grateful for the influence of my family and friends. My parents have provided guidance and support, while my older sister's encouragement has been instrumental in my pursuit of technology. My friends, too, have played a significant role in shaping who I am today.</a>
